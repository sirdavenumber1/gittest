# Kuberentes Example - Control-M Agent in Persistent mode

## Intro
In this example we will focus on creating a Kubernetes <b>POD</b> with Control-M agent in container. 
During container start, Control-M Agent will register itself automatically into Control-M Server. 
Additionally, during Container graceful stop, Control-M Agent will try to disconnect and unregister from Control-M Server. 

In this example Control-M Agent will use specified port for communication - this port can be assigned automatically if needed. The connection mode will be set to persistent, agent will initiate the connection to server. This scenario makes that there is no need to open any port on K8S cluster nor need to create and maintain any objects like LoadBalancers (of course in different scenario/architecute such objects would be needed, just for single agent with no HA it is not required).

Control-M Agent will be pulled from Enterprise Manager and install files should be put into proper folder. The services that are used are described [here](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/automation-api/9019monthly/provision-service-872868763.html). 

## Image files
Docker images files are placed in image folder. Sample script to build the image is in build.sh or you can use the command below:

```
docker build --build-arg CTMHOST=<name-or-ip-of-your-em-here> --build-arg USER=<your-user> --build-arg PASSWORD=<your-password> --tag ctm/agent/rt:2.0  .
```

## Deployment file
* ctmagent_rt2.yaml - this file is example of pod definition with 1 container that uses previously defined image (ctm/agent/rt:2.0).
* ctmagent_rt2-deployment.yaml - similar to the example above, but using a deployment method with replicas count=1

To run this example, you just need to apply the configuration, i.e.:
```
kubectl apply -f ctmagent_rt2.yaml
```
