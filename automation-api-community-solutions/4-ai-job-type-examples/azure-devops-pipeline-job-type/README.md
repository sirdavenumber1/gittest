# Control-M Integration for Azure DevOps Pipelines
Azure DevOps (formerly Visual Studio Team Services) is a hosted service providing development and collaboration tools.   
[Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com)  
DevOps include many tools, like:  
    - Git repositories for source control  
    - Build and Release pipelines for CI/CD automation  
    - Agile tools covering Kanban/scrum project methodologies  
    and many others. 


## Azure DevOps Pipelines 
[What are Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/)

This folder contains sample Application Integrator jobtype for running and monitoring Azure DevOps Pipeline. 

__Note:__The authentication method used by these job types is PAT (Personal Access Token) as described in [API Doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/pipelines/runs/run%20pipeline?view=azure-devops-rest-6.1#security). For other DevOps Services please please check DOCS as they might require different methods. 


Personal Access Token can be obtained from User Settings:

### AI Azure Pipelines.ctmai

This AI job triggers Azure Pipeline via REST API.   
Required parameters (connection profile and job parameters):
- username
- PAT
- organization name (DevOps organization name like BMC)
- Project name (like DataPipeline)
- Pipeline ID (This can be short or can be proper Pipeline ID)

The actions taken by this AI job are the following:
1. Run pipeline
2. Monitor pipeline
3. Gather logs


<hr>

1. Run pipeline
- URL: https://dev.azure.com/{{Organization}}/{{Project}}/_apis/pipelines/{{PipelineID}}/runs?api-version=6.0-preview.1
- Method: POST
- Headers: Content-Type=application/json
- Body: {} (you can change it if needed)  
REST API using basic authentication.  
After successful execution, get RUNID into runtime parameter. 

<br>

2. Monitor pipeline
Monitoring is done by calling the following URL:
```
https://dev.azure.com//{{Organization}}/{{Project}}/_apis/pipelines/{{PipelineID}}/runs/{{RUNID}}?api-version=6.1-preview.1
```
In the output there are 2 parameters that are interesting: state and result.
The following logic was implemented:
- if STATE is "completed" and result is "failed" -> fail the job
- if STATE is "completed" and result is "canceled" -> fail the job
- if STATE is "completed" and result is "succeeded" -> Complete and proceed


<br>

3. Gather logs  
This step requires some additional script to traverse throught the logs. This call:
```
https://dev.azure.com/{{Organization}}/{{Project}}/_apis/pipelines/{{PipelineID}}/runs/{{RUNID}}/logs?$expand=signedContent&api-version=6.0-preview.1  
```
gets the list of the logs and returns also signed URLs to get them. The URL is valid for short time. 
Customer can create a short script to get all the logs.

How to get parameters:
- username - it is actually not used by Azure, but is required by AI Authentication - so put here anything
- PAT - get as described above
- Pipeline ID (in my case it is 2):
![Pipeline1](images/pipeline1.png)
![Pipeline2](images/pipeline2.png)  
You can also get pipeline ID from [REST API call](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/pipelines/pipelines/list?view=azure-devops-rest-6.1)
